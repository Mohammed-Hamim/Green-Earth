#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

### Answer: The differences between var, let and const in JavaScript are reassignment, scope and hoisting. For Example:
    ### 1: Var
         a) Function-scoped- accessible anywhere within the function;         
         b) It can be reassigned and re-declared within its scope.
         c) It can be hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized with undefined.
    
    #### 2: Let 
        a) Block-scoped - can only be accessible within the block where it's declared.
        b) Value is re-assignable but can not be redeclared in the same scope.
        c) Provide ReferenceError if accessed before declaration
   
    #### 2: Const  
        a) Block-scoped - can only be accessible within the block where it's declared.
        b) Value is not re-assignable but can not be redeclared in the same scope.
        c) Must be initialized with a value at time of declaration and show Provide  ReferenceError if accessed before declaration
